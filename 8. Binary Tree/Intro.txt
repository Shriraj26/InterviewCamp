In a binary tree, each node can have at most 2 nodes.
The depth of a node N is the number of nodes on the search path from root to N, not including N.
The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in that tree
Concepts like complete binary tree, full binary tree, perfect binary tree are good to know but not generally important for interviews.
A binary tree with height h can have a maximum of 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes. This will happen if all nodes have 2 nodes.
