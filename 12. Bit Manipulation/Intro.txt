Bit Manipulation is a hell of a thing and we are going to nail this shit!!!

U can perform bitwise operations like -
AND, OR, NOT, EX-OR

1. To Flip bits, u can either take one's compliment -  num ^ 1
    or u can ex-or it with one!!
    Ex - 1011 exor 1111 -- 0100
    if u want u can flip only the bits that u want that is -
    1011 if u want to flip last 2 blits, then u can ex-or with one that is only at last 2 bits that is -
    1011 exor 0011 --- 1000

2. Multiply or divide op -
    to Multiply by 2^n, u can shift left bits by n
    Ex - 1 << 4 -- 16, in this case the bits are shift towards left and res got multiplied by 2^4 that is 16
    Same for divide.

3. get bits at ith position -
    To get bits ar ith position, shift right the num by i,
    Then and it with 1
    Ex - (num >> i) & 1
    shifting right will bring the ith bit to index 0, then anding with 1 will give 1 if it was already 1
    else it will give 0
